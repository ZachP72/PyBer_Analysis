# PyBer Analysis

## Analysis
This analysis consisted of performing an exploratory analysis of a ride sharing company's data called PyBer. In this analysis various visuals were created based on the data. The key objectives were to show relationships between city type and fare costs to help determine which neighborhoods needed funding to improve access to locals for PyBers services. 

## Results
The results show that in Rural areas that there are 125 total rides and 78 total drivers which is 8% of the number of total rides you'd see in the Urban areas and 20% of the number of rides you'd see from the Suburbs. The 78 total drivers you saw in the Rural areas is just 16% of the number you would see while in the Suburbs and 3% from what you would see while in an Urban area. The other drastic difference is that while in an the Rural areas you would pay an average fare of $34.62 which is 40% more than the Urban $24.53 average fair cost.

## Summary
### Recommendations
1. Create more seamless transitions between drivers in Rural vs Urban areas so that Rural areas get increased accessability to rides. By doing this you create a round-about way for more drivers to get to Rural areas while also maintaining the quick Urban transports. 
2. Considering the average fare per driver in Rural areas is upwards of 3x than the cost of an Urban fare, find a way increase incentives for drivers going out that far. 

3. Better statistics to go off of would be Fare profit per Minute at varying times so that you can implement a system in which the more efficent area provides incentives for drivers to go to.
